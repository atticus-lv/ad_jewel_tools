A tool set created by atticus for jewel design 

## What can RSN do

> [!NOTE]
> **The core of RSN is to modify the data in the scene before rendering, which makes it more flexible** <br>

+ Render **multiple shots** in the scene, and take the name of the camera as the name of the output image   [ðŸ‘‰Link](Example1.md)
+ In each shot, objects' **placement, material and data** can be different   [ðŸ‘‰Link](Example2.md)
+ Add **animation** to one of the shots, and render with another rendering engine (such as workbench)
+ If you are not sure how long a shot will be rendered, you can send a report email to the specified email after
  rendering
+ Just press the button, you can **queue render** all the above needed shots without waiting in front of the computer
